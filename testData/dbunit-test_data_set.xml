<!--
	See DbUnit's XmlDataSet.
	Database definition for AbstractEmbeddedDbTestCase
	- uses DbUnit to load the data into an embedded derby DB -
	To connect to the DB: user sa, psw emty, url
	jdbc:derby:<absolute path to this project>\testData\testDB

	Note: Only 1 connection to the Derby DB at a time is allowed!!!!

	IMPORTANT
	=========
	1) You must have <table> entry for any table you want DbUnit to clear for you.
		Even if you don't want DbUnit to insert any data you must still declare at least
		<table name="yourSchema.yourTable" /> for the table yourSchema.yourTable to be emptied during test setUp().
	2) When using a column that contains XML value, you may use <![CDATA[ to supply the value.
		But there should be no space within '<value><![CDATA[<?xml ...' otherwise you may get Xerces'
		exception 'The processing instruction target matching "[xX][mM][lL]" is not allowed.'

	ABOUT FILE FORMAT
	=================
	This format is better than flat data set because it describes explicitly the
	columns though it's also more verbose.

	Also, thanks to setting the DbUnit feature QUALIFIED_TABLE_NAMES to true in the test,
	we can use fully qualified table names and thus have tables in different schemas.

	HOW TO CREATE
	=============
	To create a DbUnit data set like this you've several options:
	1. Write it manually.
	2. Use DbUnit itself to connect to a DB, load a data set and store it into a XmlDataSet.
	3. Use the Eclipse plugin QuantumDB and its ability to export table into DbUnit data set format.
	4. Use Jailer (http://jailer.sourceforge.net/home.htm) - it can export also only a sample of
		a DB while preserving referential integrity.
